Allows access to files on a FAT formatted SD card. Restrictions apply, such as the files must not be fragmented and must be named 8:3. Files must pre-exist on the card - no creation or other file system manipulation os supported.

This is very old code now and the initialisation sequence may not work with newer high density cards.
